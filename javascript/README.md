# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

Please refer to the [main README](../README.md) for instructions on what to do.

### Working with the JavaScript example

Everything should be set up for you to get off the ground running. This example uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to run its tests and [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/) as its assertion library. Feel free to use the documentation for both to help you write your tests. Run your tests by typing `npm test` in the command line.
