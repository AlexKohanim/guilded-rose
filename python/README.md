Please refer to the [main README](../README.md) for instructions on what to do.

### Working with the Python example

Everything should be set up for you to get off the ground running. This example uses the [PyUnit](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) to run its tests and as its assertion library. Feel free to use the documentation for it to help you write your tests. Run your tests by typing `python -m unittest discover` in the command line.
