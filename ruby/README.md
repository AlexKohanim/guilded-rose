Please refer to the [main README](../README.md) for instructions on what to do.

### Working with the Ruby example

Everything should be set up for you to get off the ground running. This example uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info/documentation/) to run its tests and as its assertion library. Feel free to use the documentation for it to help you write your tests. Run your tests by typing `rspec` in the command line.
